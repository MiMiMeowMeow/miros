  *What defines Success?*
    
    Finish the botnet example
    
      * Gandbold can send his trace from the windows box to a pi
      * Add some sort of IP discovery code outside of the battle chart
      * Gandbold can make war cries across the network can can be heard by
        others
      * Gandbold and Altan start fighting together as a unit
      * Add a third pi as a horse archer
      * Add more than one horse archer per IP address
      * Demonstrate the power of a multichart sequence
      * Re-factor the writing (make it easier to navigate)
        * Break it into a small set of examples each becoming more sophisticated

= Decide =
  *Problem*
   * [ ] Gandbold can send his trace from the windows box to a pi
  
  *Idea/Hypothesizes(>=5):*
    * [ ] Read the previous work on sending traces
    * [ ] Re-read RabbitMq tutorials
    * [ ] Get RabbitMq server working on both machines
    * [ ] Build the previous work into Gandbold as a new example file
          (horse_archer_afar.py)
    * [ ] Start by taking old work and just adding the statecharts to it

  *Backlog*
    * [ ] Add botnet example
    * [ ] Move all examples into the examples directory
    * [ ] Fix and verify all examples
    * [ ] Multi-Chart Race pattern
    * [ ] Multi-Chart Pend pattern
    * [ ] diagram semantics writing
    * [ ] Spec to diagram writing
    * [ ] Add factory examples to the state recipes
  *Weird and Fun Ideas*
    * [ ] Add statistics
    * [ ] Add Markov Chains
    * [ ] Create a sampler
    * [ ] Self organizing criticality
    * [ ] The devil's staircase

  *Someday Maybe*
    * [ ] Find a simple way of linking IP addresses to URLs for next to nothing

  *Project Workflows:*
  
    *Setting up a python project is needlessly complicated, but here are the steps*:
    * [ ] Update the state documentation... Simplify it!
    * [ ] Move your production files into a subdirectory, named after your project
          (miros)
    * [ ] Add a setup.py file at the same level as this directory
    * [ ] Install virtualenv
    * [ ] > virtualenv <whatever> # in this case: > virtualenv prot
    * [ ] In bash > source ./prot/Scripts/activate
    * [ ] In the named subdirectory, (miros), add a file called __init__.py, this
          turns it into a package.  Your test code will be able to import files
          into themselves like:  from miros.events import <Class>
    * [ ] Add a test directory
    * [ ] Name your tests as <whatever>_test.py
    * [ ] In the test files your imports should work
    * [ ] Install your local package > pip install --editable .
    * [ ] Write a super simple test that just fails with tries to import something
          from your package.  Test it with > pytest, confirm failure from assert
          not an import error.
    * [ ] Wrestle with it until it works.

    *Getting your examples folder to work*:
    
    * [ ] Navigate to the root directory of your project
    * [ ] > pip3 install -e . --user
  
    *Getting your autotester working:*
    
      > pip3 install pytest-watch --user
      > ptw
    
    *Automation of documentation:*
