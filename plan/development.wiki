  *Project Workflows:*
  
    *Recovering from the TMUX/WSL/cmd.exe bug*
      * [ ] open another shell <windows>ubuntu
      * [ ] tmux ls
      * [ ] tmux kill-session <tmux session number>
      
      *To exit*
      * [ ] tmux ls
      * [ ] tmux kill-session <tmux session number>
      
  
    *Setting up a python project is needlessly complicated, but here are the steps*:
    * [ ] Update the state documentation... Simplify it!
    * [ ] Move your production files into a subdirectory, named after your project
          (miros)
    * [ ] Add a setup.py file at the same level as this directory
    * [ ] Install virtualenv
    * [ ] > virtualenv <whatever> # in this case: > virtualenv prot
    * [ ] In bash > source ./prot/Scripts/activate
    * [ ] In the named subdirectory, (miros), add a file called __init__.py, this
          turns it into a package.  Your test code will be able to import files
          into themselves like:  from miros.events import <Class>
    * [ ] Add a test directory
    * [ ] Name your tests as <whatever>_test.py
    * [ ] In the test files your imports should work
    * [ ] Install your local package > pip install --editable .
    * [ ] Write a super simple test that just fails with tries to import something
          from your package.  Test it with > pytest, confirm failure from assert
          not an import error.
    * [ ] Wrestle with it until it works.

    *Getting your examples folder to work*:
    
    * [ ] Navigate to the root directory of your project
    * [ ] > pip3 install -e . --user
  
    *Getting your autotester working:*
    
      > pip3 install pytest-watch --user
      > ptw
    
    *Automation of documentation:*
    
      > cd doc
      > python3 automake.py &
