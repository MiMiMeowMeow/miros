*Recall Is Not Working In Active Fabric*

= Observe =
  
  *What defines Success?*
  A recall would take an event out of the defer queue and place it into the
  fifo queu, then wake up the managing thread which would cause the chart to
  run to completion.

  *What is the problem?*
  It seems to post the item into the fifo queue, but the chart does not wake up
  and run.

  *Evidence that contradicts Assumptions:*
    The run event is getting past the 'wait' queue api, with the recalled events
    The system is working, by adding a wait after the event that should have
    caused the recall, the spy log filled up with our expected items.

  *Assumptions:*

= Decide =
  *Idea/Hypotheses for Recall Is Not Working In Active Fabric: >=5*
  * [ ] The test is broken
  * [ ] The test chart is broken
  * [ ] The run_event thread is not waking up to do the work [falsified]
  * [ ] The spy log is not accessible from the main thread
  * [ ] More information is needed
  * [ ] The feature never worked, the design just wasn't completed
  
  *Chosen Idea/Hypothesis*
    The test is broken

  *Plan to Expand-on-Idea/Disprove-Hypothesis*
    * [ ] Added timing after post which should cause a reaction, expecting the
          failure to persist [the system worked after this]
