*Recall Is Not Working In Active Fabric*

= Observe =
  
  *What defines Success?*
  A recall would take an event out of the defer queue and place it into the
  fifo queu, then wake up the managing thread which would cause the chart to
  run to completion.

  *What is the problem?*
  It seems to post the item into the fifo queue, but the chart does not wake up
  and run.

  *Evidence that contradicts Assumptions:*
    The run event is getting past the 'wait' queue api, with the recalled events
  
  
= Orient =
  
  *Symptoms:*
  Recalls are posting
  The chart hangs like nothing happened, like nothing is in its fifo queue

    Can you simplify your test?
    Do you have enough information?
    What recently changed?

  *Assumptions:*

= Decide =
  *Idea/Hypotheses for Recall Is Not Working In Active Fabric: >=5*
  * [ ] The run_event thread is not waking up to do the work [falsified]
  * [ ] The spy log is not accessible from the main thread
  * [ ] More information is needed
  * [ ] The test chart is broken
  * [ ] The feature never worked, the design just wasn't completed
  
  *Chosen Idea/Hypothesis*
    The run_event thread is not working up to do the work

  *Plan to Expand-on-Idea/Disprove-Hypothesis*
    * [X] in the run_event method of the ActiveObect class print the signal
          names and confirm you see the signal name you aren't expecting
    * [X] on the other side of the wait call, write the signal names and see if
          the recalled signal is there
