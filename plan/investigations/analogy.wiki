  *What is the problem?*
  
    We need a better analogy.
    
    It is easy to think about things that exist:
    
      People, actions and objects on a landscape governed by simple rules
      
    Find something new, that is easy to think about that maps onto these parts
    of your current analogy:
      
      a game board
      marbles named as signals
      payloads inside of marbles
      a rule book as being unchanging between games
      game board as being the thing that the designer changes
      transparent film over the whole game board
      multiple games happening at once with the same game board
      instrumentation as additional transparent sheets on the game board
      instrumentation belonging to a given game
      arrows as being grooves
      code running on grooves
      unruly players, who can play at the same time, at any time
      players don't understand the rule book
      the designer chooses the players
      un-handled marbles fall to the next lower platter
      init trigger
      entry and exit triggers
      sheet as a place to mark things
      explanation of the event processor means
      common game piece
      RTC description
      loading dock
      side views
      
    The essence of this:
      
      events as things that move on
      a three dimensional landscape, where the land is terraced
      the land exists in the dark
      a simple physics engine governs the rules, run by a personality named eve
      the same landscape can be used by many different realities (parallel programs, many eves)
      the terraces are connected by channels through which events can move
      all code runs as a side effect of an event
      events are mostly initiated by outside things that can happen at any time
      you can make events that will run against this world
      a film is layered over the landscape to mark things for one object (so eve can write things down as she tries to solve her problems)
      all the action happens in the dark, but you can place sensors on each terrace to see what is going on 
      each terrace has three people who live on it, each can roll an event
      an event will cause a burst of activity, but when the landscape and the personalities have nothing left to do
      another personality (thomas) checks a deque to see if another event has arrived from the outside, if it has it will trigger the next burst of activity
     
    Personalities:
    
      event processor -> Eve     (physics engine - the heavens)
      thread          -> Theo    (thread, manages the queues, pub/sub to other landscapes - the under world)
      init            -> init    (when an event stops on a terrace, can take you higher)
      enter           -> enter   (when an event enters a terrace)
      exit            -> exit    (when an event levels a terrace)
      target          -> Tara    (explorer spirit that does work for eve)
      source          -> Spike   (a grounding spirit for eve)
      physics         -> A set of rules the governs the behavior of our personalities
      
    Let's build a little universe.  Our universe will have an extremely simple
    physics that will govern the behavior of it's tiny gods and worker spirits.
    
    Our universe will consist of a heaven, an underworld and an earth.  The
    earth will be made up of a set of terraces.  On every terrace their will
    live three spirits, Indica, Ena and Xena, collectively known as the "bowling
    team".  The heaven will have one goddess Eve, "the goddess of physics" and
    the underworld will be ruled by Theo, "the joiner".  Eve controls all of the
    terrace spirits and her two helper spirits, Tara "the explorer" and Spike
    "the source".
    
    Let's put our little universe into a small multiverse. Each universe will
    have it's own heaven and underworld, gods and spirits, but its terraces can
    be shared by all universes.
    
    Our little universe can react to real world events, that first appear as
    named bowling balls in it's underworld.  Theo, "the joiner", will notice
    then when they arrive in the underworld's loading dock.  His job is to pass
    this ball to Eve and wait for her to finish her work.  Eve uses her
    understanding of the universe's physics to control her spirits.
    
    To do this work, eve will look from her vantage point in heaven to find
    spike, "the source".  He will be standing somewhere on a terrace.  Then she
    will command Tara, "the explorer" to search for a groove

  * [ ] A simple video game with a simple physics engine
  * [ ] The callbacks themselves as layered in space, just use code, don't use a
        mind model at all
  * [ ] multi-layered printed circuit board 
  * [ ] "adding another dimension to object oriented programming"
  * [ ] Use the criterion method; boil down the existing parts into its
        underlying essence
  * [ ] Run your problem statement as a filter and generate at least five ideas
