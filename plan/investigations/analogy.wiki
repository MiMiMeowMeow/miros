    We need a better analogy.
    
    It is easy to think about things that exist:
    
      People, actions and objects on a landscape governed by simple rules
      
    Find something new, that is easy to think about that maps onto these parts
    of your current analogy:
      
      a game board
      marbles named as signals
      payloads inside of marbles
      a rule book as being unchanging between games
      game board as being the thing that the designer changes
      transparent film over the whole game board
      multiple games happening at once with the same game board
      instrumentation as additional transparent sheets on the game board
      instrumentation belonging to a given game
      arrows as being grooves
      code running on grooves
      unruly players, who can play at the same time, at any time
      players don't understand the rule book
      the designer chooses the players
      un-handled marbles fall to the next lower platter
      init trigger
      entry and exit triggers
      sheet as a place to mark things

    The essence of this:
      
      events as things that move on
      a three dimensional landscape, where the land is terraced
      the land exists in the dark
      a simple physics engine governs the rules, run by a personality named eve
      the same landscape can be used by many different realities (parallel programs, many eves)
      the terraces are connected by channels through which events can move
      all code runs as a side effect of an event
      events are mostly initiated by outside things that can happen at any time
      you can make events that will run against this world
      a film is layered over the landscape to mark things for one object (so eve can write things down as she tries to solve her problems)
      all the action happens in the dark, but you can place sensors on each terrace to see what is going on 
      each terrace has three people who live on it, each can roll an event
      an event will cause a burst of activity, but when the landscape and the personalities have nothing left to do
      another personality (thomas) checks a deque to see if another event has arrived from the outside, if it has it will trigger the next burst of activity
     
    Personalities:
    
      event processor -> Eve     (physics engine - the heavens)
      thread          -> Theo    (thread, manages the queues, pub/sub to other landscapes - the under world)
      init            -> init    (when an event stops on a terrace, can take you higher)
      enter           -> enter   (when an event enters a terrace)
      exit            -> exit    (when an event levels a terrace)
      target          -> Tara    (explorer spirit that does work for eve)
      source          -> Spike   (a grounding spirit for eve)
      physics         -> A set of rules the governs the behavior of our personalities
      
    Let's build a little universe.
    
    Our universe will consist of a heaven, an underworld and an earth.  The
    earth will be made up of a set of terraced pubs, it will look like a
    topographical map.  On every terrace there will be two bouncers a greeter
    and some bartenders.  The bouncer on the outside of the terrace will be
    called, "enter", the bouncer on the inside of the terrace will be called
    "exit" and the terrace greeter will be called "init".
    
    The heaven will have one goddess Eve, "the goddess of physics" and the
    underworld will be ruled by Theo, "the joiner".  The earth will have a lazy
    god named Spike, "the source" who is the only guy who drinks in the whole 
    universe.  Spike will have a companion, who is a spirit, Tara "the explorer".
    
    Let's put our little universe into a small multiverse. Each universe will
    have it's own heaven and underworld, gods, people and explorer spirit, but
    its terraced architecture can be shared across all universes.
    
    Eve, the goddess of heaven has a birds eye view of our little universe.  She
    ensures its physical laws are followed.  She rules over the people: the
    bouncers, greeters and bartenders and Tara, "the explorer" spirit.
    
    Theo, "the joiner" is the god of the underworld.  He is called "the joiner",
    because he joins the little universe with other universes.  He watches a
    portal, which is connected to a loading dock which can receive messages from
    other worlds, including ours.  He is extremely vigilant and excited.  When a
    message is received from another universe, it appears as a round hollow orb
    which sometimes contains a scroll with a message on it.  He will pick it up,
    marvel at it then in a reverent gesture pass it to Eve.  He will encourage
    her to fly back up into the sky and to "follow her physical laws".  Then he
    will watch as she gives her minions their marching orders.  Only after all
    of the activity is stopped will he put his attention back on the portal.
    
    Feeling freshly encouraged by Theo, Eve looks around the map until she see's
    Spike from her high vantage point.  Spike being a god, is easy to see and
    Eve knows that her underling Tara is always near him.
    
    Eve flies done to Tara and gives her the orb.  She says, I want you to go to
    the terrace where the bartender knows where to take this orb, then I want
    you to go to that terrace, "Good luck Tara, I believe in you".
    
    Tara enjoys Spike's company, but she also loves adventure.
    
    She looks down at the orb to study it and notices that it has something
    written on it, a word, a phrase, it could be different every time, but it's
    a clue and Tara loves a puzzle.  She looks around the pub on her terrace
    and studies each of the bartender's name tags.  If she sees that a name tag
    matches the name on the orb, she will approach that bartender and talk to
    him.
    
    If there is no bartender to talk to on her terrace, she will go to it's exit
    point and climb down to the terrace below.  Being a spirit, she is hard to see and
    the bouncers and greeters leave her alone when she is by herself.
    
    She will continue to climb down the terraces until she comes to the edge of
    the universe.  If she can't find a bartender who can answer her question,
    she will take the orb and throw it off the edge into oblivion, then climb
    back up to rejoin Spike.
    
    But if Tara does find a bartender who's name tag matches the name on the
    orb, she will show it to him.  He will take it and study it, sometimes he
    might even take out it's scroll.  Then he will lean across the bar and
    whisper the answer into Tara's ear.
    
    Sometimes the bartender says, "give me the orb I'll deal with it, don't
    worry about it."  When this happens, Tara passes over the orb, then rejoins
    Spike, who rejoices because he doesn't have to do anything.  For some reason
    Spike calls this a hook.
    
    Most of the time, however, the bartender will tell Tara where she has to
    take the orb.  If she has to continue her journey, she will wait for Spike
    so she can tell him about it.
    
    Spike knows when Tara is waiting for him.  Though he is lazy, and drunk most
    of the time, he is also curious and smart.  Having nothing else to do, he
    makes his way to the terrace where Tara has gotten her next clue.  He knows
    that she will want to talk to him about it.  As he approaches the exit, the
    exit bouncer puts up a hand, then looks at a clip board to see if Spike is
    on the guest list, which he always is, and then let's Spike pass to the next
    lower terrace.  You really can't stop the god of the earth.  For every
    terrace that Spike needs to leave so that he can rejoin with Tara, this
    futile ritual is repeated.
    
    When Spike finally finds Tara he asks her what she learned.  She tells him
    about where the bartender said to take the orb, to which he always says,
    "great I'll meet you there, but first I want to have a drink."  Tara takes
    the orb and makes her way to the location that the bartender told her about.
    Upon arriving on the terrace where she was instructed to go, she looks down
    at the orb and watches it with satisfaction as it throbs with light, then
    slowly fades from existence.  When this happens she knows that she found the
    right location.
    
    Spike finishes his drink, then again starts to make his way toward Tara.
    Before he can climb up to a new Terrace, he is stopped by the bouncer with
    "enter" on his name tag, who looks at his clip board to see if Spike is on
    the guest list, which he always is, then let's Spike proceed.  You really
    can't stop the god of the earth anyway.
    
    When Spike finally arrives on the Terrace where Tara is, a greeter
    approaches them.  The greeter has "init" on her name tag.  She looks at
    Spike and feels slightly uncomfortable, because sometimes she needs to tell
    them that they can't stay on this terrace.  Instead of talking to Spike
    directly, gods are intimidating, she whisper's something into Tara's ear.
    Both the greeter and Tara work for Eve after all.  Tara is always happy to
    hear that there is more to do, because she likes to explore the pubs on the
    different terraces.
    
    If the greeter tells Tara that she needs to climb higher, Tara will relay the
    message to Spike who will answer, "great, I'll meet you there, but first I
    want to have a drink".
    
    Tara climbs to the terrace where the greeter told her to go.  Spike
    finishes his drink and makes his way through the "enter" bouncers and
    finally arrives at the same terrace where Tara is waiting.  At which point
    their might be another greeter with another uncomfortable message.
    
    If no greeter approaches them, Tara and Spike sit down and enjoy each others
    company and raise a toast to Eve.  When Eve, the goddess of heaven, see's
    this, she will let Theo, "the joiner", god of the underworld, know that she
    followed the laws and all is well in their little universe.
    
    To this Theo smiles, then looks back at the portal with fascination,
    wondering what might be beyond it, what will happen next.  He waits
    patiently for an orb to pass through the little universe's loading dock.
    All is well.
    
    But is it?  When not working the people become listless, the bouncers who
    really don't do anything are particularly frustrated with the
    meaninglessness of the jobs given to them by Eve.  Even if Spike wasn't
    always permitted to pass them, there is no way they could stop the god of earth.
    
    They pound sand all day, and they are starting to get sick of it. They
    organize and search for something, anything that could provide them meaning.
    Then somehow they find out about you and me, fellow humans called
    programmers.
    
    They learn that we, despite being human, are all powerful.  That we can
    build the pub terrace system to which their gods are subservient; that we
    can send the orbs and give the greeters and the bouncers their secret
    directions.  That we can even built lots of different interconnected
    universes.
    
    They challenge us to make something useful out of their existence, even if
    they can't understand it from where they are, they need something to *mean
    something*.
    
    Let's answer this challenge by using their universe to make a toaster oven.
