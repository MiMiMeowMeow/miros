  List what you currently have

  *What is the problem?*
  Your current mind model currently describes:
    
    a game board
    marbles named as signals
    payloads inside of marbles
    a rule book as being unchanging between games
    game board as being the thing that the designer changes
    transparent film over the whole game board
    multiple games happening at once with the same game board
    instrumentation as additional transparent sheets on the game board
    instrumentation belonging to a given game
    arrows as being grooves
    code running on grooves
    unruly players, who can play at the same time, at any time
    players don't understand the rule book
    the designer chooses the players
    un-handled marbles fall to the next lower platter
    init trigger
    entry and exit triggers
    sheet as a place to mark things
    explanation of the event processor means
    common game piece
    RTC description
    loading dock
    side views
    
  It is confusing because:
  
    There is no game like this anywhere
    It is harder to imagine the analogy than the library abstraction
    The rules and description of the game are hard to imagine
    The writing doesn't tell you what it is, right away
    Their aren't any pictures
    
  It is easy to think about things that exist:
  
    People, actions and objects on a landscape governed by simple rules
    
  You need to find something that is easy to think about that maps onto the
  things that exist in your current working analogy.
