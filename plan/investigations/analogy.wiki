  *What is the problem?*
  Your current mind model is complicated and confusing, this is what we have
  right now:
  
    a game board
    marbles
    marbles named as signals
    payloads inside of marbles
    rule book
    rule book as being unchanging between games
    game board as being the thing that the designer changes
    transparent film over the whole game board
    multiple games happening at once with the same game board
    instrumentation as additional transparent sheets on the game board
    instrumentation belonging to a given game
    arrows as being grooves
    code running on grooves
    unruly players, who can play at the same time, at any time
    the designer chooses the players
    un-handled marbles fall to the next lower platter
    init trigger
    entry and exit triggers
    sheet as a place to mark things
    common game piece
