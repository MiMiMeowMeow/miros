*Rabbit Disconnection Exception*
= Observe =
  *What defines Success?*
    A working re-write of miros-rabbitmq using the the pika async example code. 
    
  *Immediate Goal:*
    * [X] Adjust the RabbitNetwork Api to make it really easy to use.
      * [X] rn.urls
      * [X] rn.other.urls
      * [X] rn.this.url
    * [X] Adjust the timeout in the RabbitNetwork to be a class const
  
  *Immediate problem?*
    
  *Global problem?*
    My botnet was working, based on an old and unreliable way of using pika
    (from RabbitMq docs).  
    
    But this code would fail after running for > 15 minutes.  The time-to-test was
    too long to troubleshoot that approach, so I decided to re-write everything to
    work from the pika project's stable example.  Errors seen in my previous version:
    
      One two bots (WSL):
        pika.exceptions.ConnectionClosed: (-1, "ConnectionResetError(104, 'Connection reset by peer')")
      
      The other two bots:
        pika.exceptions.ChannelClosed
        
    So, there needs to be a number of resets and other complications that were
    not talked about in the RabbitMq-pika training examples. (My old code is
    broken and the testing cycle takes > 15 minutes)
    
    To avoid this problem again I will use the pika documentation's complicated
    pika-asyncronous example as a starting point, then wrap it with the
    functionality required for miros-rabbitmq
