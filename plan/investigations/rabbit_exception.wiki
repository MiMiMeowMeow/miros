*Rabbit Disconnection Exception*
= Observe =
  *What defines Success?*
  Make a new, reliable version of the networking software based on the examples provided
  from the pika docs instead of the pika docs provided by RabbitMq

  *What is the problem?*
  My botnet was working, based on an old and unreliable way of using pika.  But
  this code would fail after running for > 15 minutes.  The time-to-test was too
  long to troubleshoot that approach, so I decided to re-write everything to
  work from their stable example.

  *Evidence that informs Assumptions:*
  
  Previous issues:
    One two bots (WSL):
      pika.exceptions.ConnectionClosed: (-1, "ConnectionResetError(104, 'Connection reset by peer')")
    
    The other two bots:
      pika.exceptions.ChannelClosed
  
= Orient =
  The consumer will by on the pi
  The producer will be on the WLS
  The user/password will be the same as before
  
  The exchange is defined by the consumer, the producer's machine does not have the exchange
  The pi exchange: http://192.168.1.69:15672/#/exchanges
  The WLS exchange: http://127.0.0.1:15672/#/exchanges

  *Questions for Rabbit Disconnection Exception:*
    Can I understand their code?
    Can I find a way to make the problem fail sooner. 
    Can you simplify your test?
    Do you have enough information?
    What recently changed?

  *Assumptions:*

= Decide =
  *Idea/Hypotheses for Rabbit Disconnection Exception: >=5*
  * [ ] Reproduce old issue; time it [too long]
  * [X] Get networking working
  * [X] Get user_name/password working
  * [X] Pass a string
  * [ ] Understand their code in detail (obey, cooperate, diverge)
  * [ ] Try to pass different strings using an API call into their example
  * [ ] Refactor their code to work with your botnet (generate new work list)
  * [ ] Pound the exchange and see if it fails [it worked]
  * [ ] Run it to failure and see what happens
  
  *Chosen Idea/Hypothesis*
  Run it to failure and see what happens
    PUBLISH_INTERVAL = 0.00000000000000000000001
    time to failure: after 5 minutes, I stopped the test.  It didn't fail.
