*Rabbit Disconnection Exception*
= Observe =
  *What defines Success?*
  We could run the botnet at 1:1 or any time compression and the RabbitMq
  library pika would not kill the program.

  *What is the problem?*
  It seems that pika is programmed this way.  It routinely disconnects and
  issues exceptions.  A fast running program will work, but a slow running
  program will fail.

  *Evidence that informs Assumptions:*
  
= Orient =
  *Symptoms:*
  A fast running botnet will work; one set to 1:1 time compression will fail. 
  
  *Questions for Rabbit Disconnection Exception:*
    Can you simplify your test?
    Do you have enough information?
    What recently changed?

  *Assumptions:*
  * This is a pika problem
  * That a reconnection callback must be added to any pika program
  * That there example was a hanging example (just enough rope to hang yourself)

  *Idea/Hypotheses for Rabbit Disconnection Exception: >=5*
  * [ ] Reproduce the issue; time it
  * [ ] Search the exception online; try their ideas
  * [ ] Port any solution back into the miros_rabbit package
  * [ ] Port solution back into the pika docs in your library
  * [ ] Possible re-write of all networking code is required
