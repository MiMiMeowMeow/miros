  *What defines Success?*
  Make to problem appear sooner
  
  We could run the botnet at 1:1 or any time compression and the RabbitMq
  library pika would not kill the program.

  *What is the problem?*
  It seems that pika is programmed this way.  It routinely disconnects and
  issues exceptions.  A fast running program will work, but a slow running
  program will fail.
  
  The problem takes too long to reproduce, so, we won't address it.  Instead we
  will aim the investigation at making it occur sooner.

  *Evidence that informs Assumptions:*
  The program fails after 13:28 minutes.  Yesterday it was failing sooner
  A second test ran past 15 minutes
  A second test broke at ~20 minutes
  
  One two bots (WSL):
    pika.exceptions.ConnectionClosed: (-1, "ConnectionResetError(104, 'Connection reset by peer')")
  
  The other two bots:
    pika.exceptions.ChannelClosed

  *Symptoms:*
  A fast running botnet will work; one set to 1:1 time compression will fail. 
  
  *Questions for Rabbit Disconnection Exception:*
    Can you simplify your test?
    Do you have enough information?
    What recently changed?

  *Assumptions:*
  * The issue is partially masked by the previous bug fix.
  * This is a pika problem
  * That a reconnection callback must be added to any pika program
  * That there example was a hanging example (just enough rope to hang yourself)

= Decide =
  *Idea/Hypotheses for Rabbit Disconnection Exception: >=5*
  * [ ] Reproduce the issue; time it
  * [ ] To reproduce it, shut off the snoop network after a set amound of time
        and wait for it to fail
  * [ ] Try to speed time before the issue occurs
  * [ ] Search the exception online; try their ideas
  * [ ] Port any solution back into the miros_rabbit package
  * [ ] Port solution back into the pika docs in your library
  * [ ] Possible re-write of all networking code is required
  
  *Chosen Idea/Hypothesis*
  Reproduce the issue and time it, faster this time.
  * remove the time out changes made a couple of days back
  * re-run test and see if you can get it to fail faster
    

  *Plan to Expand-on-Idea/Disprove-Hypothesis*
