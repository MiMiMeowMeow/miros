*Trace Heisenbug*
= Observe =
  *What defines Success?*
  My trace outputs would display the signal names as strings

  *What is the problem?*
  My trace outputs are writing numbers instead of strings.
  If I use a print statement in the code, the bug disappears.

  *Evidence that contradicts Assumptions:*
  
= Orient =
  *Symptoms:*
  - printing the trace will output a number instead of a signal name
  - adding a print statement within the append_fifo_to_spy method makes the bug
    go away.
  
  *Questions for Trace Heisenbug:*
    Can you simplify your test?
    Do you have enough information?
    What recently changed?
    Who else has seen a heisenbug from python print?

  *Assumptions:*

= Decide =
  *Idea/Hypotheses for Trace Heisenbug: >=5*
  * [ ] Research and find some tricks
  * [ ] Add asserts, if the code asserts, bisect the problem
  * [ ] It has something to do with closures
  * [ ] It is weirder than you can imagine
  * [ ] Add a pdb break point and trouble shoot from within the code, land and
        start and see if the heisenbug happens upon a break too.
        
  *Chosen Idea/Hypothesis*
  * Add a pdb break point and trouble shoot from within the code, land and
    start and see if the heisenbug happens upon a break too.
