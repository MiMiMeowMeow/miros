*trace dead*
= Observe =
  *What defines Success?*
  The trace would always run despite how long the program runs

  *What is the problem?*
  The trace instrumentation dies after the program runs for a long time.

  *Evidence that contradicts Assumptions:*
  
= Orient =
  *Symptoms:*
  Using the networked_horse_archer.py set to time compression 50:1 the trace
  dies after running for 2:24
  
  *Questions for trace dead:*
    Can you simplify your test?
    Can you baseline?
    Do you have enough information?
    What recently changed?
    Can you speed up the test?
    Why does this effect the trace and not the spy?

  *Assumptions:*

= Decide =
  *Idea/Hypotheses for trace dead: >=5*
  * [ ] It is the trace buffer
  * [ ] It is something you can't think of
  * [ ] It is the post event queue
  * [ ] You need more information
  * [ ] Why does this effect the trace and not the spy?
  * [ ] It smells like a queue problem
  * [ ] Can you speed up the failure by shrinking the queue size?
  * [ ] The queue should be a ring buffer, is it?

  *Chosen Idea/Hypothesis*
  Can you speed up the failure by shrink the queue size?    

  *Plan to Expand-on-Idea/Disprove-Hypothesis*
  * find the location of the queue used by the trace output
  * reduce the queue size, rerun the test
  * expect the failure to occur before 2:24
