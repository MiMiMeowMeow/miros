*trace dead*
= Observe =
  *What defines Success?*
  The trace would always run despite how long the program runs

  *What is the problem?*
  The trace dies after a prolonged period of testing

  *Evidence that contradicts Assumptions:*
  
= Orient =
  *Symptoms:*
  Using the networked_horse_archer.py set to time compression 50:1 the trace
  dies after running for 2:24
  
  *Questions for trace dead:*
    Can you simplify your test?
    Do you have enough information?
    What recently changed?
    Can you speed up the test?
    Why does this effect the trace and not the spy?

  *Assumptions:*

= Decide =
  *Idea/Hypotheses for trace dead: >=5*
  * [ ] It is the trace buffer
  * [ ] It is something you can't think of
  * [ ] It is the post event queue
  * [ ] You need more information
  * [ ] Why does this effect the trace and not the spy?
