*mirrored rabbit connection not working*

= Observe =
  
  *What defines Success?*
  I would like one statechart to be able to tx/rx to itself while running on one
  machine across a network

  *What is the problem?*
  It is based on example d of the rabbit tutorial series
  The connection doesn't seem to be working

  *Evidence that contradicts Assumptions:*
  Ports needed to be open windows.  This has been added to the setting up
  rabbitmq docs.
  
= Orient =
  
  *Symptoms:*
  Running code on both computer, but nothing is received
  
  *Questions for mirrored rabbit connection not working:*
    Can you simplify your test?
    Do you have enough information?
    What recently changed?
    Can you take smaller steps.

  *Assumptions:*
  I am assuming that the tutorial d is working

= Decide =
  
  *Idea/Hypotheses for mirrored rabbit connection not working: >=5*
  * [X] Issue with firewall on windows
  * [X] Move the d tutorial experiment into the examples folder
  * [X] Move onto both machines
  * [X] Adjust files so they will automatically work despite where they are
        located.
  * [X] Move onto both machines
  * [X] Get the example working, the switch the names over to that wanted by the
        mirror
  * [X] Move onto both machines
  * [X] Converge files into one file acting as rx/tx from command line
  * [X] Move consume into it's own thread so it doesn't control the program flow
  * [X] Get python command line tools onto Linux systems
  * [X] Add callback control to your wrapper classes
  * [X] Add encryption/decryption
  * [X] Send an Event across the network
  * [ ] Refactor
  * [ ] Create a statechart that can manage input and output
  * [ ] Extend statechart to work without 
  
  *Chosen Idea/Hypothesis*
   Confirm assumption that example d works 

  *Plan to Expand-on-Idea/Disprove-Hypothesis*
   * [ ] Run RX/TX on windows/pi 
   * [ ] Run TX/RX on windows/pi
   * [ ] window is 72
   * [ ] window is 73
