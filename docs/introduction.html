<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Miros is a statechart library written in Python.  Statecharts are a type of
behavioral drawing.</p>
<p>These drawings use a kind of formalism that was invented by Dr. David Harel in
the 1980s to help the Israeli air force construct better software for their jet
fighters.</p>
<p>His innovation was to take the sentences that you would find in a specification
and quickly translate them into an easily understood picture.  These pictures
were different from the other types of technical drawings that were used at the
time.  You could pack a lot more complexity into them, all the while keeping
them from needlessly spreading over multiple pages and becoming more
complicated than the code that they were suppose to describe.</p>
<p>The diagrams were easy to explain and they were easy to turn into software.</p>
<p>For this reason statecharts have been used to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Allow software to write itself to automatically find better software algorithms</li>
<li>Describe the quantum interactions of atoms</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="interactingcharts.html#on-firmware"><span class="std std-ref">Create infinitely-expensive-engineering-systems (F22/F35)</span></a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="quickstart.html#quick-start"><span class="std std-ref">Design toaster ovens</span></a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="patterns.html#nuclear-fusion-example"><span class="std std-ref">Control Fusion Reactors</span></a></li>
</ol>
<p>These pictures will also reduce the cognitive load you experience while designing
and building your system.  Think about how hard it would be to perform a double
digit multiplication problem using Roman numerals, whereas the same problem can
be performed effortlessly using Arabic numbers by a child in grade 3.  A hard
problem can be transformed into an easy problem by using a better point of
view.</p>

<p>As a library, Miros provides most of the features expected to express your
Harel statechart pictures in running Python software.  The same pictorial
formalism is used by industrial software frameworks like Matlab and Miro
Samek’s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.state-machine.com/">QP framework</a> for embedded systems, just to list a few.  So, you can
quickly prototype your ideas using this library in Python, then port your work
into compiled production code if you need the performance such systems provide.
Or you can use it as the reactive portion of your Python project while still
having access to the legion of other libraries written in Python.</p>
<p>Miros is not a drawing tool.  It is a way to express your drawing as running
software.  The <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-harel-formalism"><span class="xref std std-term">Harel drawing formalism</span></a> is simple
enough to be expressed on a napkin, or a piece of paper – both of which are
excellent technologies for expressing a Harel <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-statechart"><span class="xref std std-term">statechart</span></a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-harel-formalism"><span class="xref std std-term">Harel Formalism</span></a> for drawing
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-statechart"><span class="xref std std-term">statecharts</span></a> was digested by the UML standard in the 1990s.
Though, <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-uml"><span class="xref std std-term">UML</span></a> itself has proved to be an overcomplicated failure,
but there are parts of it that are useful.  The statechart formalism and
resulting sequence diagrams turn out to be in the good parts of UML.  If you
need to describe your designs in pictures, you can use a UML tool to draw your
statecharts and import them into your documents.  I use a simple and free
drawing tool called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.umlet.com">umlet</a>.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with how to draw Harel <span class="xref std std-term">statecharts</span>,
I recommend that you read the <a class="reference internal" href="quickstart.html#quick-start"><span class="std std-ref">quick start</span></a> section.  There I
will describe a system that you already understand as a
<a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-statechart"><span class="xref std std-term">statechart</span></a>, then go through how to express that thing using
the miros library.</p>
<p>If you already know what <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#term-statechart"><span class="xref std std-term">statecharts</span></a> are and you just want
to see how to use this library, jump to the <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#examples"><span class="std std-ref">examples</span></a> section.
There I create a number of simple statecharts and show how to build them. Then
I go into greater detail about how to reflect upon their behavior as you make
it react to events.</p>
<p>If you know how to use the library and just need to know how to implement
something using a programming example, jump to the <a class="reference internal" href="recipes.html#recipes"><span class="std std-ref">recipes</span></a>
section.  It contains examples of the small lego-blocks you will need to build
up your structure.</p>
<p>If you would like to expand your architectural abilities, read the
<a class="reference internal" href="patterns.html#patterns"><span class="std std-ref">patterns</span></a> section.</p>
<p>The library is called miros in honor of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samek">Dr. Miro Samek</a> who has written so
much about how to implement such systems.  The event processor within this
library is based on his publications.  This should make it easy to use the
miros library for prototyping, or testing a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.state-machine.com/">QP framework</a>.</p>
