<p>This library is intended for three different audiences, so I have constructed
three separate quick start sections:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#quickstart-new-to-statecharts"><span class="std std-ref">quick start for people new to statecharts</span></a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#quickstart-quick-start-for-python"><span class="std std-ref">quick start for people experienced with statecharts</span></a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#quickstart-going-to-port-to-embedded"><span class="std std-ref">quick start for embedded developers</span></a></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="section" id="quick-start-for-embedded">
<span id="quickstart-going-to-port-to-embedded"></span><h2>Quick Start for Embedded<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-start-for-embedded" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As an embedded developer you will probably port your working miros Python code
to C/C++ for a considerable performance gain.  If you are looking for an excellent,
and affordable framework, go to the source and use the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/qpc">qp codebase</a>.  It is documented here:
<a class="reference external" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qpc/files/doc/PSiCC2.pdf/download">Practical UML Statechart in C/C++, 2nd Edition</a>.</p>
<p>There are two different ways to make statecharts with this miros Python library.
In this example, I will show you the programming technique that is best suited
for porting your code to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/qpc">qp framework</a>:</p>
<p>Let’s build a toaster oven that pays for itself, here is its <strong>specification</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It will contain a bitcoin miner that runs hot enough to toast things.</li>
<li>It will have an oven element that can bake things.</li>
<li>While toasting or baking, the inside of the toaster oven should glow red.</li>
<li>When the door is closed, and the oven is not heating, no light should be on.</li>
<li>When the door is opened, the heating should stop.</li>
<li>When the door is opened, a white light should turn on, so the customer can see their food.</li>
<li>When the door is closed after it has been opened, the toaster oven should behave like it did before the door
was opened.</li>
<li>the bitcoin miner should survive very high temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a statechart picture that meets these specifications:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object.svg" src="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>If you intend on porting this code to C/C++ for your embedded platform, it is
best to use the miros <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ActiveObject</span></code> class rather than the miros <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Factory</span></code> class.</p>
<p>Here is how you could code this using miros and the ActiveObject class.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">miros</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">ActiveObject</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">miros</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">signals</span>

<span id="quickstart-an-analogy"></span><h3>An Analogy<a class="headerlink" href="#an-analogy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you don’t know what a statechart is, think of it as a kind of board game that
you can use to solve problems.</p>
<p>This board game has a board with a picture on it, some marbles that the players
can place and then roll around the board in accordance to the game’s rulebook.
It has a game piece that all of the members can move once it is their turn to
play. The players don’t move the game piece directly, but they move it by having
their marbles interact with the board.  To do this, your board game would have
grooves for the marbles to roll in.   If one player moved the game piece
on their turn, the next player will start their turn at this new position.</p>
<p>As the board game designer, you would have control over the drawing on the
board, and you would design some of the marbles that are used by the players,
but you wouldn’t control the rulebook or a player’s specific behaviour, what fun
would that be?</p>
<p>The players of your game could be people, touching an external user interface.
At the moment they press a key, an electrical signal would be sent into your
computer and then turned into a software abstraction of the key-press event that
could affect your board game. But a player doesn’t have to be a person; it could
be a countdown timer that fires an event every 3 seconds, it could be the stock
market, it could be the weather. A player in this metaphor is just something in
the outside world that can trigger the events.</p>
<p>To distinguish one event from another event, we will call them by different
names: signal names. Sometimes an event carries additional information, let’s
call this a payload. Going back to our metaphor, think of an event as a marble.
A player would build a marble and put it on the board when it was their turn to
play the game. Every marble would have a signal name painted on it, and
sometimes, deep within the marble would be a payload.</p>
<p>The player would place their marble on the board at the current location of the
game piece, let go of it and watch it roll. As it rolled on the board, it might
trigger software that you have written into that marble’s groove. It might
trigger additional marbles to pop out of the board and roll in turn, but
eventually, the action would stop, and the common game piece would be moved to
its new position, and the next player would get to play.</p>
<p>Every game has a rule book. In our case, the rulebook is called the Harel
Formalism. These rules govern how the marble can move on the board and how the
game piece is shifted in response.</p>
<p>The statechart board game also has rules about when a player gets to play. If
one player really needs to put a marble on the board while another is playing,
it is OK. She will just put it into a loading dock. The statechart board game
will only let one player play out their marble on the board at a time; this rule
is called run to completion (RTC). When a player’s marble has finished moving
around the board, our board game will check it’s loading dock to see if another
marble is waiting within it.</p>
<p>The loading dock is a python deque. The thing that will load the marble onto the
board when the game has finished processing the last player’s marble is a python
thread.</p>
<p>So what does this board game look like? Well, it looks kind of like a bunch of
rounded rectangles connected with arrows. The arrows have signal names painted
on them to describe paths that certain marbles can follow and the rounded
rectangles are called states.</p>
<p>All the states have names, and a state can be within another state. As the
different players play the game, the common piece is moved around the board,
coming to rest within one of the states. This is called the resting state.</p>
<p>The rules are pretty straightforward, but who wants to read a rulebook anyway?
The players certainly don’t. So, you as the board game designer and the board
game itself must know the rules. The board game’s software that applies the
rules to the marbles on the board is called the event processor. It is based
upon the algorithm invented by Dr. Miro Samek.</p>
<p>So how is this useful? Well, your game has software on its game board that can
run when a marble rolls over it. You can connect this software to the output of
your computer; so you can control things in the outside world. Your board game,
statechart, could be used to control a trading strategy, it could be used to
control the massive doors over a stadium, automatically reacting to changes to
weather forecasts.  You could build a sprinkler system for your garden that
checks weather and soil conditions and will turn on when the plants need it or
if the garden is being raided by deer.</p>
<p>Getting down to brass tacks, what do we do now? Well, I have to show you how to
draw a board game; I have to show you how to draw a statechart. We will use UML.
I have to show you how to connect your board game to its automatic rulebook: the
event processor. I have to show you how to create your custom marbles, the
events and their payloads and how to send these to the board game so that you
can connect outside things into the events to which your statechart will react
too.</p>
<p>Once you know how to draw the pictures, you will need to know how to translate
this into code. Lastly, I will show you how to see if your statechart is
working; so that it can give you feedback about what it is doing. You can use
this feedback to both troubleshoot your design and to describe how it works to
others.</p>

<p>So now I will design a board game that is easy to understand.
Let’s build a toaster oven that pays for itself, here is its <strong>specification</strong>:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It will contain a bitcoin miner that runs hot enough to “toast” things.</li>
<li>It will also have a heating element that can “bake” things.</li>
<li>While toasting or baking, the inside of the toaster oven should glow red.</li>
<li>When the door is closed, and the oven is not heating, no light should be on.</li>
<li>When the door is opened, the heating should stop.</li>
<li>When the door is opened, a white light should turn on.</li>
<li>When the door is closed after it has being opened, the oven should continue
what it was doing before the door was opened.</li>
<li>The bitcoin miner should survive very high temperatures.</li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The name “Self Paying Toaster Oven” is a marketing ploy.  A better name for
our product should be called the “Toaster Oven Lottery Ticket”, since it is
very unlikely our little bitcoin miner will succeed at mining a bitcoin.</p>
</div>
<p>Here is a <a class="reference internal" href="reading_diagrams.html#reading-diagrams-reading-diagrams"><span class="std std-ref">statechart picture</span></a> (board game) that meets these specifications:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object.svg" src="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>Let’s break the board game image into its parts, from the top down:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_0.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_0.svg" src="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_0.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>The top of the diagram, highlighted in blue, describes the <a class="reference internal" href="reading_diagrams.html#reading-diagrams-classes"><span class="std std-ref">class</span></a> that we want to use from the miros library.  This
class will provide our game’s rulebook, the thread which our game will run in and
deques needed for our players to load their marbles.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_1.svg" src="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_1.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>We inherit from the ActiveObject to make a new class called
SelfPayingToasterOven.  We put all of the worker-methods and the attributes,
needed by our specific board game inside of this derived class.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_2.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_2.svg" src="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_2.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>In the diagram above, the hierarchical state machine (HSM) is highlighted in
blue. This specific type of state machine is called a hierarchical state
machine, because it has states within states, making a hierarchical structure.
We will talk about the benefits of this shortly.</p>
<p>The miros package uses the HSM as a specification for behaviour. The state
machine doesn’t keep any information about what happens when your program
interacts with it. All of that information is kept within the object that uses
it. Because of this, a state machine can be used by many different
processes at the same time.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_3.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_3.svg" src="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_3.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>The icons highlighted blue in the above diagram represent the attachment point
between our toaster object and it’s state machine. Using our game metaphor,
think of this attachment point as a transparent plastic sheet that our toaster
puts over the game board. The event processor can write information onto this
sheet so that the game can keep track of its state without marking up the game
board directly.</p>
<p>The game is started where the attachment point is made, in the above example it
is like writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>construct an object from the class containing the event processor
(SelfPayingToasterOven)</li>
<li>place a transparent plastic sheet down over the board game (our HSM)</li>
<li>on the sheet, use a marker to note that the beginning position is the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code>
state.</li>
<li>begin the game</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This attachment point is a useful fiction, but if you dig into the code, the
statemachine is actually a set of functions that reference one another.  These
functions have two arguments, a handle to your specific
object and an event. These functions call your code
and call other functions in accordance to the rulebook of the game.  A state
machine’s function doesn’t have it’s own memory, it uses the memory of the
object provided as it’s first argument.  We won’t get into the details of this
yet, but know that your statemachine functions are actually the thing from
which the picture emerges.</p>
</div>
<p>Before I start talking about the dynamics of our game, let’s clear up some
terminology:</p>
<p>A <strong>statechart</strong> is a state machine operating within a thread, which has access to
information about its previous state. It has queues that can be used to store up
events (marbles played by players who don’t want to wait for their turn to
play).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mechanics-the-game-s-dynamics">
<span id="quickstart-dynamics"></span><h3>Mechanics: The Game’s Dynamics<a class="headerlink" href="#mechanics-the-game-s-dynamics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let’s start the game:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># build a self paying toaster oven with a working bitcoin address</span>
<span class="n">toaster</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">SelfPayingToasterOven</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;142x5ZhQEMk5LLjXGZeiTBWpv2oxQpfaHJ&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">toaster</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start_at</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">door_closed</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will cause the game dynamics to turn on; the event processor starts rolling
marbles onto the board.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_4.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_4.svg" src="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_4.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">start_at</span></code> call will cause the game to enter the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code>
state (1).  As a result, the event processor will roll an entry marble onto the
board.  This is caught by the entry handler of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code> state, calling
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">white_light_off()</span></code> method of the toaster (2).  Now the game is in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code> region of the diagram.</p>
<p>The event processor rolls an init marble onto the board, and this is caught by
the black dot within the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code> region (3).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The black dots with connected arrows are called “init pseudostates” in UML.
Think of them as, “What do I do when I land in this region?”. From now on I’ll
call these block dots, init icons.</p>
</div>
<p>The marble follows the groove into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">off</span></code> state.  Since the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">off</span></code> state was entered the event processor rolls an entry marble to it.  Its
entry handler runs the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">oven.history=off</span></code> code in the context of the toaster
object (4).</p>
<p>At this point, the play is over, because the event processor has nothing left to
do.  Another way of saying this is that the run to completion process (RTC) is
finished.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">off</span></code> state is marked onto the transparent plastic sheet as the
starting state for the next play of the game.</p>
<p>Since there is nothing left to do, the statechart thread looks to see if there
is a marble in it’s loading dock.  The marble might have been played during the
last RTC process by another player.</p>
<p>Now suppose that while the game was running its startup code, someone pressed
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bake</span></code> button on the outside of our toaster, in code this would look like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">toaster</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">post_fifo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Event</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">signal</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">signals</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Bake</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here is what would happen:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_5_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_5_1.svg" src="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_5_1.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>The event processor would begin its work by checking to see if the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">off</span></code>
state knew what to do with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bake</span></code> marble.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">off</span></code> state doesn’t know,
so the event processor would roll the marble outward on the board to the next most
outer state: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code>, and ask it if it knows what to do with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bake</span></code> marble.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code> state has a named groove called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bake</span></code>, so it knows what
to do with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bake</span></code> marble (1).  The bake groove is trying to dump its marble
from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code> state into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baking</span></code> state, but before the event
processor can do this, it must exit out of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">off</span></code> state.</p>
<p>So the event processor gives itself a sub-goal to transition from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">off</span></code> to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baking</span></code>.  To begin this work it marks an S on the board over the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">off</span></code>
state and marks a T on the board on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code> state. S stands for
source and T stands for target.  Then it figures out how to transition from the
S to the T:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>it needs to exit the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">off</span></code> state.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exit the off state it rolls an exit marble to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">off</span></code> state handler.
There isn’t one so nothing happens (2).</p>
<p>Now the event processor is in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code> state.  It’s new target is the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baking</span></code> state.  So it marks an S on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code> and a “T” on
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baking_state</span></code>.  Then it makes a list of the work required to transition
from “S” to “T”:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>enter the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">heating</span></code> state, then</li>
<li>enter the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baking</span></code> state.</li>
</ul>
<p>To do this, it rolls an entry marble to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">heating</span></code> state, which is caught
by its handler and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">oven.red_light_on()</span></code> is run, then the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">oven.bitcoin_miner_on()</span></code> is run (3).  Then the event processor rolls an entry
marble to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baking</span></code> state.  This causes our program to run
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">oven.heating_element_on()</span></code> then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">oven.history</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">baking</span></code> (4).</p>
<p>The event processor is now in a new region, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baking</span></code> state region.  It
looks for an init icon, and it’s groove (a black dot with an arrow), but there
isn’t any, so it stops searching for work to do (5).</p>
<p>It is at this point that the second RTC process is completed.  So the event
processor marks <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baking</span></code> as the next starting point for the game and passes
control back to the statechart’s thread so it can check it’s loading dock for
player marbles.</p>
<p>We just learned about one of the benefits of having an HSM.  We get automatic
grooves.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">off</span></code> state didn’t have to be explicitly connected to the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baking</span></code> state.  The Bake marble rolled outward till the event processor found
something that knew what to do with it.  This means in our game metaphor we
should think of the inner states as being higher off the ground than the outer
states; this way it becomes easy to imagine what the marbles do.  If they aren’t
explicitly handled with a named arrow from the state that was rolled the marble,
they fall outward until they are.</p>
<p>Guess what happens when a marble isn’t handled by an outer state?  That’s right,
it rolls off the outer edge, is ignored, and no state transition occurs (only
costing us a few wasted cycles).</p>
<p>Now let’s do something perilous; let’s turn off the oven.  Here is what
would happen if you were <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baking</span></code> and you issued an Off event:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">toaster</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">post_fifo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Event</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">signal</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">signals</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Off</span><span class="p">))</span>

<p>The thing to understand about the miros library is that it works with a special
type of callback function.  If you haven’t seen a callback function before, it
is just a function that is given to another function, so that it can be called
later.</p>

<p>The rectangles on the game board, or the states in your HSM, are represented as
functions in your Python code.  These state functions will be given to the event
processor; which will call them over and over again as it follows the rules
of the game.  So your state functions are just callback functions.</p>
<p>These state functions will all have the same argument list:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">some_state_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">statechart_object</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="c1"># do stuff</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To see how this ties into our self paying toaster oven:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/statechart_to_code_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/statechart_to_code_1.svg" src="_images/statechart_to_code_1.svg" /></div>
</a>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">door_closed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">oven</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="c1"># do stuff</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Remember before how I said that your HSM is just your application’s behavioral
specification.  Well, you can see how this might be true if you look at the
first argument.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">oven</span></code> in this callback’s signature is referencing the
SelfPayingToasterOven object.  So we can write the state callback to do things
with that object, like call one of it’s methods, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">oven.white_light_off()</span></code> or
we can write something to one of it’s attribute’s: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">oven.history</span> <span class="pre">==</span>
<span class="pre">door_closed</span></code>.  Provided the door_closed callback only manipulates the memory of
it’s first argument, it can be called with different oven objects and behave the
same for all of them.</p>
<p>This is exactly how we create the transparent film over our game board.  None of
the state callbacks will keep their own state information, instead, they will write
their saved information onto their first argument.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk about the second argument of our state callback function; the
event.  In our game metaphor the event is the marble.  It will have a signal
name and an optional payload.</p>
<p>Our state callback function can react to events by using an if-elif-else
structure:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">door_closed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">oven</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">):</span>

  <span class="c1"># ...</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">status</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This is how the above code relates to our diagram:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/statechart_to_code_2.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/statechart_to_code_2.svg" src="_images/statechart_to_code_2.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>Our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code> state callback can transition to another state using the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trans</span></code> method as seen with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Off</span></code> and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bake</span></code> signals.  The result
of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trans</span></code> method is put in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">status</span></code> variable.  <strong>So you can think
of the</strong> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trans</span></code> <strong>method as providing the named grooves in your game.</strong>  You
can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trans</span></code> method to draw your named arrows on your diagram.</p>
<p>Not only do your state callback functions describe what is suppose to happen
with a specific state, but they also describe the topology of your diagram.</p>
<p>Your callback functions describe this topological arrangement in two ways, with
their <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">else</span></code> clause and with their <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trans</span></code> calls.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">else</span></code> clause in the case of our states will tell the event processor what
state is outside of the current state.  If there is nothing outside of our
state, then we return a special keyword, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">top</span></code>.  Consider the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">else</span></code>
structure in this code listing:</p>

</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">else</span></code> clause answers the question, “what do I do with this event (marble)
if this callback function doesn’t know what to do with it?”  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">else</span></code> clause
answers by saying, “I don’t know what to do with this, but you should try my
parent state, who’s address I’ll write in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">temp.fun</span></code> attribute for you.”
Just so you know that I’m suggesting to look outward, I’ll set the status
variable to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">return_status.SUPER</span></code>.</p>
<p>If your state callback represents the outermost state of your design, set the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">temp.fun</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">top</span></code>, as seen above.</p>
<p>To be completely explicit I will write the else clauses of all of the states
used by this design:</p>

<p>So the else clause is the thing that puts the H in HSM.  It provides the
hierarchy to our state machine.  A useful way to mentally manipulate your HSM
diagrams is to imagine them from the side, so that you can see how their
behaviors are layered:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_side_view.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_side_view.svg" src="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_side_view.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>Let’s remove the top view of our HSM and just look at it’s side projection:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_side_view_2.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_side_view_2.svg" src="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_side_view_2.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>The states that are above other states automatically get the behavior of their
lower states.  So the higher a state is in our HSM’s side view, the more
behavioral complexity it has.  To be baking, the software would have behaved in a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">heating</span></code> way and a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code> way already.  As an example of this, I’ll
simplify the above diagram, and roll our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baking</span></code> state an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Off</span></code> marble:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_side_view_3.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_side_view_3.svg" src="_images/bitcoin_toaster_oven_active_object_side_view_3.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>You can just glance at the diagram and see what will happen.  The marble will
roll off baking, into heating, off heating into door_closed and then end up in
the off state.  Specifically, our event processor will:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>run any code on the Off arrow, or run any code in the elif <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">e</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">signals.Off</span></code> clause of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">door_closed</span></code> callback</li>
<li>run the elif <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">e</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">signal.EXIT_SIGNAL</span></code> clause of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baking</span></code> callback</li>
<li>run the elif <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">e</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">signal.EXIT_SIGNAL</span></code> clause of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">heating</span></code> callback</li>
<li>run the elif <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">e</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">signal.ENTRY_SIGNAL</span></code> clause of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">off</span></code> callback</li>
<li>run the elif <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">e</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">signal.INIT_SIGNAL</span></code> clause of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">off</span></code> callback</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now that we can see how the hierarchy relates to our statechart dynamics, let’s
consider what our state callbacks return.  The state callback must return a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">return_status</span></code> object to it’s event processor.  In our code examples we store
this result in a variable named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">status</span></code>.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">status</span></code> variable is very
important to the event processor, since it tells it if it needs to continue
searching for work to do, or if it is done processing.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">return_status</span></code> object needs to be imported from the miros library.  It
contains a number of named attributes like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UNHANDLED</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HANDLED</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SUPER</span></code> which can be used to tell the event processor how your state reacted
to a specific event.</p>
<p>So, your state function knows who its parent state function is.  It knows how it
should handle events and it knows how to cause a transition to another state
function.  But, it doesn’t know how the full graph is ordered, the event processor
figures this out on the fly.</p>
<p>The event processor has a lot of work to do.  It needs to discover the full
structure of your statechart and it needs to implement the rule book of your
game.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The naming of the internals signals to ENTRY_SIGNAL, INIT_SIGNAL, EXIT_SIGNAL
where named this way to make it easy for you to port your code to the qp framework.
For similar reasons, the setting of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">temp.fun</span></code> to the name of the state
of the parent was done this way so you can easily jump between the c/C++ and the
Python varient of Miros Samek’s algorithm. (if you choose to do so)</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s back off from the details for a moment to reflect upon what our
callback has to do:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/statechart_to_code_4.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/statechart_to_code_4.svg" src="_images/statechart_to_code_4.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>The idea about using the same callback function for many different things, to be
used to discover a graph and to be used to react to events may seem strange to
you.  Likewise, the idea of adding a new physical dimension to your code may
also seem strange, but with this added dimension makes many hard things simple.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Remember that the event processor’s algorithm was designed to be very fast
and to work with limited computer resources; it was built as a drop in
replacement for real time operating systems in embedded applications.</p>
<p class="last">If you use this programming technique you are outsourcing a lot of the programs
complexity to the event processor.  Miro Samek calls this “inversion of
control”.  In fact his entire business model is based upon it.</p>
</div>
<p>Now lets look at the H in the circle, with the star beside it.  This is UML
short hand for, “transition back to the state in this region that we were in
before we left this region.”  You can see why we would want to use it with our
toaster oven.  When the user opens the door, we want to turn off the toaster
oven heating equipment and turn on a white light.  When they close the door,
they expect the toaster to operate like it did before.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">In UML this is H in a circle with a star beside it is called the “transition

</div>
<p>The Miros Samek algorithm doesn’t intrinsically support this feature, but it is
easy to implement in your application code.  You just save the state address
when you enter it, and when you need to transition back to the old state, you
transition the state held in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">history</span></code> attribute.</p>

<p>There is one last thing I want to talk to you about before I show you the

<p>We now understand how to make a statechart diagram and how to program it using
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">miros</span></code>.  But, there is a big step between writing code and writing <em>working
code</em> – we need someway to debug applications written with this library.</p>
<p>The debugging of our design will be tricky, since the event processor is calling
our functions to build up a graph and make an event follow the rules of the
game.  If we put a breakpoint in one of our state callback functions, then step
past it’s return point, well, “<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons">here be dragons</a>”.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Microsoft has recently released a version of Visual Studio, who’s debugger
will only step into code that you have changed.  This feature would be
extremely valuable for debugging statecharts with miros.</p>
</div>
<p>Instead of trying to debug our state functions by stepping into the event
processor, we could litter our state functions with print statements. Or, we
could do a lot better than this: we could turn on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">miros</span></code> instrumentation.</p>
<p>The instrumentation can be thought of as another transparent piece of plastic you
put over any state you want to monitor on your game board.  This plastic
sheet has a bunch of sensors and wires embedded within it.  As your game is being
played, the sensors detect and record, any action on their part of the game
board.  To access this information, you can either use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spy</span></code> or the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trace</span></code> interface provided by the ActiveObject class.</p>
<p>To turn on the instrumentation, you place the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;spy_on</span></code> decorator above your
state callback functions.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">There obviously isn’t really any clear plastic film with
wires and sensors in it, but there is a function that is wrapping your state
function so that it can report everything it has seen back to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">miros</span></code>
debugging deque.</p>
</div>
<p>As previously stated, the miros library provides two different logging
techniques so you can see how your statecharts have reacted to events.  One
provides great detail, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spy</span></code>, and the other, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trace</span></code>, provides a
high level view.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spy</span></code> outputs every step made by your event processor.  It can be
referenced after your program has finished running, or you can set it output
information as it sees it:</p>

<div><p>I’m going to try and show how a miros statechart works, without using
technical-language.  To do this, I’ll tell you a story about some characters

<p>The story will have some pictures, which I have created using a UML drawing
tool.  The images are intended to get someone who hasn’t seen UML before,
comfortable looking at statecharts drawn this way.  These pictures will act as
a bridge between the story and how to program a statechart.  If an image is
too small in your browser, click on it to open it as a full-sized pdf.</p>
<p>If you find the story is confusing, don’t worry, a concrete and
straightforward statechart example will follow it.  With each reading, the
statechart mechanics should become more and more evident.</p>

<h3>Story<a class="headerlink" href="#story" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let’s build a little universe.</p>
<p>Our universe will consist of a heaven, an earth and an underworld.   The earth
will be made up of a set of pubs, arranged on different terraces.  To get to a
higher pub, you would first have to walk through a lower pub.  The lower pubs
are for a more general audience, while the higher pubs, though having less space
have a more specialized aesthetic.</p>
<p>On every terrace, there will be two bouncers a greeter and zero or more
bartenders.   There will only be one set of stairs that can be used to enter or
exit a pub, and this is where that pub’s bouncers will be.</p>
<p>One bouncer will be facing in the direction of people entering the terrace and
the other will be facing in the direction of people wanting to leave it.  The
greeter will talk to anyone who has decided to stay on her terrace.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_terraced_pubs.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_terraced_pubs.svg" src="_images/md_terraced_pubs.svg" /></div>
</a>
<div class="admonition-hint admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">hint</p>
<p>Each pub is a state in a statemachine.  You would program these states as
functions that take two arguments, a reference to an activeobject and an
event.</p>
<p>These state functions will contain an if-elif structure which will have
multiple clauses.  The greeter is the “init” clause, and the enter and exit
bouncers are the “entry” and “exit” clauses.</p>
<p>The “init”, “enter”, and “exit” clauses can be activated when the state
function is given an event with an init, entry or exit name.</p>
<p class="last">Likewise, the bartender is a clause where the application developer sets the
event name.</p>
</div>
<p>The heaven will have one goddess Eve, “the goddess of law and order” and the
underworld will be ruled by Theo, “<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">the solipsist.</a>”  The earth will have a lazy god
named Spike, “the source” who happens to be the only guy who can drink in the
whole universe.  Spike will have a companion, who is a spirit, Tara “the
explorer.”</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_terraced_gods.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_terraced_gods.svg" src="_images/md_terraced_gods.svg" /></div>
</a>
<div class="admonition-hint admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">hint</p>
<p>Eve represents the “event processor”, or the algorithm that sends the state
functions different events.</p>
<p>Spike, represents the “Source” state while the event processor is searching
the statechart.  Think of Spike as the current state of the statemachine.</p>
<p>Tara represents the “Target” state, which is used by the event processor to
explore the statemachine while it is trying to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>Theo is the “thread” in which all of the code is run.  The event processor and
all of it’s calls to the various state functions will be driven by this
thread.</p>
<p class="last">An application developer will not write code to change the internal behaviour
of the event processor, the source and target states or the thread.  This is
why these characters are supernatural in the story; it’s a mnemonic.</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s put our little universe into a small multiverse. Each universe will have
it’s own heaven and underworld, gods, people and explorer spirit, but its
terraced architecture of pubs, can be shared across all connected worlds.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_multiverse.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_multiverse.svg" src="_images/md_multiverse.svg" /></div>
</a>
<div class="admonition-hint admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">hint</p>
<p>Anytime a statechart references a callback, that callback will change the
internal variable state of the active object in its first argument – the
state callback functions do not have their own memory.</p>
<p class="last">Since the callback functions don’t keep any information, they can be called by
many different activeobjects, in its thread, and behave as expected; there are
no side effects.  In this way, many different active objects can use the same
set of state callback functions.</p>
</div>
<p>Eve, the goddess of heaven has a birds-eye view of our little world.  She rules
over the people: the bouncers, greeters and bartenders and, Tara, “the explorer”
spirit.  She took on her duty as “the goddess of law and order” with such gusto,
that sometime in the world’s history, she banned alcohol consumption for
everyone on earth, except Spike, who she can’t control.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_eve.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_eve.svg" src="_images/md_eve.svg" /></div>
</a>
<div class="admonition-hint admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">hint</p>
<p>Eve is the “event processor”.  The if-elif clauses, represented by the people
in the story, exist within each of the state functions.  These if-elif clauses
only become active when the event processor calls its function with an
internal event, represented by one of the people in the story.</p>
<p>Tara, the “target state” is used by the event processor when it is searching a
statemachine to see which state handles an external event.</p>
<p class="last">Since the event processor calls the function and change’s its target state
while it is searching through a statemachine, we say that Eve rules over the
people and Tara the “explorer spirit”.</p>
</div>
<p>Theo, “the solipsist” is the god of the underworld.  He is only called the
“solipsist” by people outside of his universe, like us, because his universe
only works and exists if he is thinking about it.  Nobody in his world is aware
that he has this power.</p>
<p>One of Theo’s duties is to join the little universe with other universes.  Theo
watches a portal, which is connected to a loading dock which receives
messages from different worlds, including ours.  He is extraordinarily attentive
and enthusiastic.  He can motivate anyone he talks to or even looks upon, in
fact, this is his supernatural ability.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_theo.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_theo.svg" src="_images/md_theo.svg" /></div>
</a>
<div class="admonition-hint admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">hint</p>
<p class="last">Theo represents a “thread” pending on a queue.  The activeobject’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">post_fifo</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">post_lifo</span></code> methods allow an application developer to put events into
this queue.  When the thread sees that a queue has an item, it will wake up,
and drive the event processor, which in turn, will call the functions
making up the statemachine.</p>
</div>
<p>When Theo receives a message from another universe, it appears as a round hollow
orb which sometimes contains a scroll.  He calls these orbs “events”, and if they
have a scroll within them, he calls that scroll a “payload”.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_events.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_events.svg" src="_images/md_events.svg" /></div>
</a>
<div class="admonition-hint admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">hint</p>
<p>An event has a name, called a signal, which can be a user defined name or it
can be a predefined name.  An event with a user defined signal name is called
an external event.  An event with a predefined name is called an internal
event.</p>
<p>The whole point of naming an event with a signal is so that a state function
can use an if-elif clause to “catch” the event when it is given to that
function.  When such an event is caught, your code is run.</p>
<p class="last">An event can have an optional payload.</p>
</div>
<p>When an “event” comes through the portal, Theo will pick it up, marvel at it
then in a reverent gesture, pass it to Eve.  They both become excited, maybe
even a little nervous, because they know there universe is going to change; it
will react to the event.</p>
<p>Theo encourages Eve to fly back up into the sky and to “follow the laws.” Then
he will watch as she gives her minions their marching orders.  Only after all of
the activity stops, will he focus his attention back on the portal.</p>
<p>Feeling oddly refreshed and encouraged by Theo, Eve looks around the map until
she see’s Spike from her high vantage point.  Spike being the god of the earth,
is easy to see and Eve knows that her underling-spirit Tara, “the explorer”,  is
always near him.</p>
<p>Eve flies done to Tara and gives her the event.  She says, “I want you to go to
the terrace where there is a bartender who knows what to do with this event.
Then I want you to go to wherever he tells you to take it.  Good luck Tara, I
believe in you”.</p>
<p>Tara enjoys Spike’s company, but she also loves adventure.</p>
<p>She looks down at the event to study it and notices that it has something written
on it, a word, a phrase, it could be different every time, but it’s a clue and
Tara loves a puzzle.  She looks around the pub on her terrace and studies each
of the bartender’s name tags.  If she sees that a name tag matches the name on
the event, she will approach that bartender and talk to him.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_events_bartenders.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_events_bartenders.svg" src="_images/md_events_bartenders.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>If there is no bartender to talk to on her terrace, she will go to it’s exit
staircase and descend to the next terrace.  Being a spirit, she is hard to see
and the bouncers and greeters leave her alone when she is by herself.</p>
<div class="admonition-hint admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">hint</p>
<p>The terraces are just callback functions containing if-elif-else clauses.  The
else clause of each callback function provides information about what other
callback function should be called if it doesn’t know what to do with a given
event.  This other function, can be thought of as a lower terrace.</p>
<p class="last">The bartender represents an if-elif clause that matches the name of the event
given to that function.</p>
</div>
<p>She will continue to climb down the terraces until she comes to the edge of the
universe.  If she can’t find a bartender who can answer her question, she will
take the event and throw it off the edge of the earth, into oblivion, then climb
back up to rejoin Spike.  In such rare cases their universe doesn’t react to the
event.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_oblivion.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_oblivion.svg" src="_images/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_oblivion.svg" /></div>
</a>
<div class="admonition-hint admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">hint</p>
<p class="last">Here we are starting to explore a statechart’s dynamics.  If your statemachine
doesn’t handle an event in any of it’s callback functions, the event will be
ignored.</p>
</div>
<p>But if Tara does find a bartender who’s name tag matches the name on the event,
she will show it to him.  He will take it and study it, sometimes he might even
take out it’s scroll.  Then he will lean across the bar and whisper the answer
into Tara’s ear.</p>
<p>Sometimes the bartender says, “give me the event I’ll handle it, don’t worry
about it anymore.”  When this happens, Tara passes over the event, then rejoins
Spike, who rejoices because he doesn’t have to do anything.  For some reason
Spike calls this a “hook”.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_hook.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_hook.svg" src="_images/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_hook.svg" /></div>
</a>
<div class="admonition-hint admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">hint</p>
<p>Tara, the “target state” is used by the event processor to find which state
callback function knows how to handle a given event.  In the above picture we
see that T started in “C pub”, then the event processor recursed outward to “A
pub” at which point it found an if-elif clause in the “A pub” callback that
“handled” the event with the signal name of “Merve”.  If the application
developer placed code between the “Merve” clause and it’s return statement,
this code would be run while T is searching.</p>
<p>When a state callback function returns “handled” the event processor pulls T
back to where S is, then it stops searching.</p>
<p class="last">A state callback function can use the T state of the event processor to
perform this type of event handling.  For more details about this programming
technique, read about the <a class="reference internal" href="patterns.html#patterns-ultimate-hook"><span class="std std-ref">ultimate hook
pattern.</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>Most of the time, however, the bartender will tell Tara where she has to take
the event.  If she has to continue her journey, she will wait for Spike so she can
tell him about it.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_reaction_1.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_reaction_1.svg" src="_images/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_reaction_1.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>Spike knows when Tara is waiting for him.  Though he is lazy, and drunk most of
the time, he always has something interesting to say, and this is what Tara
loves about him.  Having nothing else to do, he makes his way to the terrace
where Tara has gotten her next clue.  He knows that she will want to talk to him
about it.  As he approaches the exit, the exit bouncer puts up a hand, then
looks at a clip board to see if Spike is on the guest list, which he always is,
and then let’s Spike pass to the next lower terrace.  You really can’t stop the
god of the earth.  For every terrace that Spike needs to leave so that he can
rejoin with Tara, this futile ritual is repeated.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_reaction_2.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_reaction_2.svg" src="_images/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_reaction_2.svg" /></div>
</a>
<div class="admonition-hint admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">hint</p>
<p>Tara, the “target state” is used by the event processor to recurse outward
from C1 to find a state that knows what to do with the Event, who’s signal
name is Mary.</p>
<p>The A state has an if-elif clause which handles Mary, and within the clause
there is a transition to the B2 state.  In this scenario, the A state is
called the Least Common Ancestor, LCA of S and T.  S needs to exit all states,
from it’s current state, to the LCA.  However, it should not exit the LCA.</p>
<p class="last">As an application developer, you don’t really care about the LCA acronym.  You
just need to understand the dynamics of exits work.</p>
</div>
<p>When Spike finally finds Tara he asks her what she learned.  Bubbling with
excitement, she tells him about where the bartender said to take the event, to
which he always says, “great I’ll meet you there, but first I want to have a
drink.”  Tara takes the event and makes her way to the location that the
bartender told her about.</p>
<p>Spike finishes his drink, then again starts to make his way toward Tara.  Before
he can climb up to a new Terrace, he is stopped by the entry bouncer, who looks
at his clip board to see if Spike is on the guest list, which he always is, then
let’s Spike proceed.  You really can’t stop the god of the earth anyway.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_reaction_3.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_reaction_3.svg" src="_images/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_reaction_3.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>When Spike finally arrives on the Terrace where Tara is, a greeter approaches
them.  She looks at Spike and feels slightly uncomfortable, because sometimes
she needs to tell them that they can’t stay on this terrace.  Instead of talking
to Spike directly, gods are intimidating, she whisper’s something into Tara’s
ear.  Both the greeter and Tara work for Eve after all.  Tara is always happy to
hear that there is more to do, because she likes to explore the pubs on the
different terraces.</p>
<p>If the greeter tells Tara that she needs to climb higher, Tara will relay the
message to Spike who will answer, “great, I’ll meet you there, but first I want
to have a drink”.</p>
<p>Tara climbs to the terrace where the greeter told her to go.  Spike finishes his
drink and makes his way through the entry bouncers and finally arrives at the
same terrace where Tara is waiting.  At which point there might be another
greeter with another uncomfortable message.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_reaction_4.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_reaction_4.svg" src="_images/md_bartenders_on_the_hsm_reaction_4.svg" /></div>
</a>
<p>If no greeter approaches them, Tara looks down at the event and watches with
satisfaction, as it throbs with light, then slowly fades from existence.  To
this, Spike smiles and looks towards heaven, as he raises a toast to Eve.</p>
<p>When Eve, the goddess of heaven, see’s this her shoulder’s relax and the tension
releases from her back: The laws were followed.</p>
<p>Theo, “the solipsist”, god of the underworld, has been watching the whole scene,
and its “run to completion”.  Knowing there is nothing left to do in the
universe, he turns his gaze back to the portal.  He waits patiently for an event
to pass through the little universe’s loading dock.  All is well.</p>
<div class="admonition-hint admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">hint</p>
<p>The run to completion, RTC, concept is very important to understand.  Your
statechart will only react to one event at a time.  The thread will only
process the next event when the event processor has run out of things to do
with your old event.</p>
<p class="last">For this reason, you should not put blocking code into your statecharts.  If
you do, they will stop reacting to events and become unresponsive.</p>
</div>
<p>But is it?  Sometimes when Theo, “the solipsist”, god of the underworld, closes
his eyes and daydreams; his attention briefly drifts back to his world.  This is
enough to wake everyone up from their non-existence.</p>
<p>When the people wake up, they become listless. The bouncers who have had nothing
to do since the prohibition was announced by Eve, are particularly frustrated
with the meaninglessness of their jobs.  They only have one customer now.  Even
if Spike wasn’t always permitted to pass them, there is no way they could stop
the god of earth. Why have a universe full of pubs if only one guy can drink?
It seems so pointless.</p>
<p>Then somehow they find out about you and me, fellow humans called developers.</p>
<p>They learn that we, despite being human, are all powerful.  That we can build
the pub terrace system to which their gods are subservient; that we can send the
events and give the greeters and the bouncers their secret directions (arrows on
the diagram).  That we can even built lots of different interconnected universes
and have them communicate with each other.</p>
<p>They challenge us to make something useful out of their existence, even if they
can’t understand it from where they are, they need something to <em>mean
something</em>.  So, they create an organized campaign: “hack the humans”.  This is
how it works: All of the humans in the little universe, open themselves to run
code from our universe, while they are talking to either Tara or Spike.</p>

<p>Here is a warning that they provide us about UML:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/md_translation_with_notes.pdf"><div align="center" class="align-center"><img alt="_images/md_translation_with_notes.svg" src="_images/md_translation_with_notes.svg" /></div>

<p>The above diagram shows us how a lot of information is missing from a “UML
statechart”.  The diagram describes some class information, and a behavioral
specification for the states provided as a bird’s eye view of the terraced bar
system, but there is no information about the thread, <strong>S</strong>, <strong>T</strong>, the deques,
the events or any of the dynamics for the statechart.</p>
<p>So the human’s provide us with the option of laying down a spy-carpet over any
bar in their universe. If you lay this carpet down, it will record and report
all activity that transpired between <strong>T</strong>, <strong>S</strong> and any human within that pub.
To use this carpet you apply the <strong>spy_on</strong> decorator on the callback function
representing a pub, or state in the HSM.</p>
<p>Let’s answer their challenge for meaning, by using one of their universes to make
a toaster oven:</p>
