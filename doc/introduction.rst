Introduction
============
With miros you can program state machines where the states can contain inner
states.  These types of programs are called Hierarchical State Machines, HSMs,
statecharts or behavioral maps. If you have no idea what these mean jump to the
:ref:`quick-start`. :ref:`deferred-event-state-pattern`

miros is a Hierarchical State Machine library written in Python. It provides an
extremely simple API from which complex statecharts can be constructed and
tested within minutes.

HSMs have been used in the research for AI derived software development, they
are found in advanced military equipment and are great for managing financial
software. They are used in many different embedded applications.

You can also use miros to prototype your embedded architecture then implement it
using the `QP framework`_, written by `Dr. Miro Samek`_.
