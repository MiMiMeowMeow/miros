ActiveObject Example
--------------------
In this example we will show how to build the statechart structure described
above using an `ActiveObject`.

But this diagram is only describing how we want to react to events.  What is
missing from the picture is the action itself; what events are happening and
when.  The `ActiveObject` allows you to control this action, and watch what
happens as a result.  It provides the facilities to reflect upon the action that
the statechart took as a response to your programmed stimulation.  

This reaction could be a change of state, or just a running of custom code upon
a signal detection.  In the above diagram we see that in response to entering
the `inner` state the diagram would like us to print "hello world".  This can't
happen without stimulation of the chart and we will see how to do that within the
example.

First we import some items from the miros library:

.. code-block:: python

  from miros.event import Signal, Event, return_status, signals
  from miros.activeobject import ActiveObject, spy_on

Then we define the :abbr:`signals(the arrow labels in the diagram)` which our
:abbr:`events(the arrows)` will use:

.. code-block:: python

  signals.append("WaitComplete")
  signals.append("ResetChart")

The signals object is derived from a :abbr:`singleton class (all objects
instantiated from this class refer to the same object)`, so once our signals are
defined they can be accessed by any other module in our python project.  For
now, think about the signal as being the name of an event.

Now we write our state methods.  Each of these methods will represent a specific
state in our diagram.

Let start by writing the `outer` state method.  This method will represent the
rectangle labeled `outer` in the above diagram.

.. code-block:: python

  @spy_on
  def outer(chart, e):
    status = return_status.UNHANDLED
    if(e.signal == signals.ENTRY_SIGNAL):
      # outer state custom entry-code here
      status = return_status.HANDLED

    elif(e.signal == signals.EXIT_SIGNAL):
      # outer state custom exit-code here
      status = return_status.HANDLED

    elif(e.signal == signals.WaitComplete):
      # WaitComplete signal code here
      status = chart.trans(middle)

    elif(e.signal == signals.ResetChart):
      # ResetChart signal code here
      status = chart.trans(outer)

    else:
      # This signal wasn't managed, pass a
      # reference to the # method that is
      outside of us
      status, chart.temp.fun = \
        return_status.SUPER, chart.top
    return status

We see that our method is basically a big if-else structure, which reads the
signal attribute of the `e` (Event) variable and decides what to do about it. We
see that this state reacts to the `WaitComplete` by calling the ``trans`` method
with the `middle` state as an argument.  This will represent the arrow labeled
`WaitComplete` on the above diagram connecting the `outer` state with the
`middle` state.

Likewise, we see that this method calls ``trans`` with the `outer` method as an
argument when it receives an event with the signal named `ResetChart`.  This
represents the arrow which loops from-and-to the `outer` rectangle in the above
diagram.

You can pack a lot of complexity into an `ActiveObject`.  They are very dynamic
and as a result they can be very difficult to debug.  For this reason the miros
library allows you to instrument your state methods so that you can see how they
have responded to the different types of events you send at them.  

This instrumentation is done with the ``@spy_on`` decorator.  This adds a
special kind of logging to the method, more will be said about this as our
example continues.

Now lets write the middle state:

.. code-block:: python

  @spy_on
  def middle(chart, e):
    status = return_status.UNHANDLED
    if(e.signal == signals.ENTRY_SIGNAL):
      # middle entry code here
      status = return_status.HANDLED

    elif(e.signal == signals.EXIT_SIGNAL):
      # middle exit code here
      status = return_status.HANDLED

    elif(e.signal == signals.INIT_SIGNAL):
      # middle init code here
      status = chart.trans(inner)
      return return_status.HANDLED

    else:
      status, chart.temp.fun = \
        return_status.SUPER, outer
    return status

Now lets write the inner state:

.. code-block:: python

  @spy_on
  def inner(chart, e):
    status = return_status.UNHANDLED
    if(e.signal == signals.ENTRY_SIGNAL):
      print("hello world")
      status = return_status.HANDLED

    elif(e.signal == signals.EXIT_SIGNAL):
      # inner exit code here
      status = return_status.HANDLED

    else:
      status, chart.temp.fun = \
        return_status.SUPER, middle
    return status

Now that our states are defined, we create an `active object` and tell it where
to start in our diagram:

.. code-block:: python

  ao = ActiveObject()
  ao.start_at(outer)

The call to the ``start_at`` active object method will create two different
:abbr:`daemonic threads(threads that stop when the main program stops running)`,
one is for managing the active object itself and the other is for managing the
`ActiveFabric`.  The active fabric is just a process that dispatches methods
between all of the active objects in your system.  Then ``start_at`` causes the
active object to change state by climbing into the statechart to the state which
was provided as an argument; `outer`.

We can see what happened by reading some of the results of our instrumentation,
through the `spy` api:

.. code-block:: python

    print(ao.spy_full())
      # ['START', 
      #  'SEARCH_FOR_SUPER_SIGNAL:outer', 
      #  'SEARCH_FOR_SUPER_SIGNAL:top', 
      #  'ENTRY_SIGNAL:top', 
      #  'ENTRY_SIGNAL:outer', 
      #  'INIT_SIGNAL:outer', 
      #  '<- Queued:(0) Deferred:(0)']

Here we see something about the interplay between the active object and the
states which it interacts with.  Before it can climb into the `outer` state, it
needs to `search` the chart so it can know what to do.  Once it knows what to
do, it takes action by sending a series of signals at our state methods:  It
sends the entry signal to `top` (and internal state method), then the entry
signal to the `outer` state, then the `init` signal (the big black dot in our
picture) to the `outer` state.

The spy api is very detailed.  If you would like to just see a summary of what
happened you can use the `trace` instrumentation instead.

.. code-block:: python

    print(ao.trace())
      # 09:53:38.941445 [01352] None: top->outer

The `trace` is different from our `spy` in that it does not show all of the
activity resulting from our internal event processoring, but instead just shows
information about state transitions and the signal which caused the transition
to occur.  In this case there was :abbr:`no signal(the transition was caused by
a start_at)` so the `trace` displays ``None`` for the signal name.  The `trace`
does give us some new information though: it outputs a timestamp of when the
transition took place.

Now that our state is in ``outer`` state, we can send an event at it.  After
the statechart reacts we can see what happened by viewing our instrumentation:

.. code-block:: python

  # clear our spy and trace logs
  ao.clear_trace()
  ao.clear_spy()

  # Send an event with signal 'WaitComplete' so we can 
  # watch the reaction
  event_wait_complete = Event(signal=signals.WaitComplete)
  ao.post_fifo(event_wait_complete) #=> "hello world"

  # Look at the reaction of our statechart in greater detail
  print(ao.spy_full())
    # ['WaitComplete:outer',
    #  'SEARCH_FOR_SUPER_SIGNAL:middle',
    #  'ENTRY_SIGNAL:middle',
    #  'INIT_SIGNAL:middle',
    #  'SEARCH_FOR_SUPER_SIGNAL:inner',
    #  'ENTRY_SIGNAL:inner',
    #  'INIT_SIGNAL:inner',
    #  '<- Queued:(0) Deferred:(0)']

  # Look at the reaction of our chart with less detail
  print(ao.trace()) #=>
    # 10:34:47.344218 [01352] W: outer->inner

From the trace output we see that we were in the `outer` state and an event with
the `WaitComplete` signal caused us to transition into the `inner` state.  This
is true, but it doesn't really describe what happened.

If we want the full story we need to look at the results of our spy.  We see
that the system was in the `outer` state and it reacted to an event with the
signal `WaitComplete`.  It saw that it needed to transition into the `middle`
state, so it issued an event with the `entry` signal to the middle state.  If
you had code linked to this event in the `middle` state method it would have
been run.  Once it is in the `middle` state it sees that there is an `init`
handler, so it fires another event with the signal `init` which causes a
transition into the `inner` state.  Since the `inner` state required entry, the
event processor created an event with the `entry` signal and sent it to the
`inner` state.  Any entry code within the `inner` state event handler would have
been run at this point and time.  Finally, the event processor issued an other
`init` event to the inner state.  The inner state does not handle this event, so
it is ignored and our system settles into the `inner` state.  It will remain
here until it has to react to events provided by the user.

As mentioned previously, their are two different threads running in the
background since we created our `active object`.  They are both pending on
queues.  The number of items in the active object queue can be seen in our `spy`
instrumentation.  We see that at the end of this reaction to the event with the
`WaitComplete` signal, there was nothing in the queue so the `active object`
thread has nothing to do.  It is just waiting.

Lets stop both threads, and place a number of events into the queue managed by the
active object.

.. _label:
.. code-block:: python

    # stop the threads
    ao.stop()

    # clear the spy and the trace
    ao.clear_spy()
    ao.clear_trace()

    # post a number of events and see what happens
    event_wait_complete = Event(signal=signals.WaitComplete)
    event_reset_chart = Event(signal=signals.ResetChart)
    ao.post_fifo(event_wait_complete)
    ao.post_fifo(event_reset_chart)   
    ao.post_fifo(event_wait_complete)
    ao.post_fifo(event_reset_chart)

We would expect that nothing should happens since the task which is pending on
an event has been shut down.
